## About The Project

<p>The project is a Discord bot powered by the <a href="https://discord.js.org/#/">Discord.js</a> library. It contains several several slash commands which can be used to interact with the server, giving joiners a place to get involved and a personalised environment</p>

<img src="https://github.com/himakhaitan/evidentAuditDiscordBot/blob/main/resources/Project.png?raw=true">

The bot tries to make server as user-friendly as possible and make tasks like **asking for help** and **rewarding the helper** easier.

Join the server <a href="https://discord.gg/wQTr244dX6">here</a> to experience the bot.

Ofcourse, the bot doesn't server for servers of all niche so I will try to add more features in the near future. You may also suggest changes or new features by creating a new issue <a href="https://github.com/himakhaitan/evidentAuditDiscordBot/issues">here</a>.

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Built With

Below is the list of all the major frameworks and libraries used in the project.

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Installation

Following are the steps to configure the bot and make it up and running.

- Configure the Environment Variables
  - Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of the project
  - Add the following lines to the file
  ```bash
  TOKEN=DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
  CLIENT_ID=DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
  GUILD_ID=YOUR_SERVER_ID
  DB_URL=MONGO_DB_URL
  SUGGESTION=SUGGESTION_CHANNEL_ID
  MODS=MODS_ROLE_ID
  ```
  - Replace the `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `GUILD_ID`, and `DB_URL` with the actual values
  - Replace the `MODS` with the actual Discord IDs of the moderators
  - Replace the `SUGGESTION` with the actual Discord ID of the suggestion channel
  - Note: You can also use the `sample.env` file to get a template of the file

- Edit `config.js` in the root directory.

```js
const authorInfo = {
  url: "https://twitter.com/evidentaudit",
  iconURL:
    "https://github.com/himakhaitan/evidentAuditDiscordBot/blob/main/brand/logo.png?raw=true",
};

const embedColor = "#56BBF1";

const guildId = "902805157144821793";

const emoji = {
  twitter: "961985224730886174",
  linkedin: "902878634870714409",
  github: "902878634082185276",
  scam: "927206837202354206",
  pepeyes: "927212874584178708",
  evidentaudit: "933670080271777883",
};

module.exports = {
  authorInfo,
  embedColor,
  emoji,
  guildId,
};
```

Replace the dummy data with the actual values. You need to have a developers account to get all these values.
